# My-Semester-Projects
These are the top 5 python projects that I am most proud of for my first semester of AP CSP.

### Project 1: Pokemon Evolution Game
**Summary**: This program allows users to roleplay as a pokemon trainer with an Igglybuff.
**Key Features**: 
- The User's Igglybuff can evolve normally into Jigglypuff and then Wigglytuff as well as a hidden evolution to Zorua and Zoroark
- Users can train their pokemon, fight in a gym, and fight the elite four.
- The User can save the game onto a save file named pokemon-game-save.txt
